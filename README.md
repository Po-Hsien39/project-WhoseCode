## Note-taking Service

Allows you to create your own notes in your space.

## Features

1. Run Code in the Note! (Currently Support Python / Javascript)
2. Collaborating Editing
3. See differences between different versions

## Techniques

1. Fork processes and using Docker to run different Code Languages.
2. Implement CRDT YATA Algorithm to perform collaborating editing.
3. Implement LCS Algorithm to show difference between versions.

## Demo

### Collaborating Editing

#### Using Doubly Linked List Data Structure to make sure Eventual Consistency

1. Make sure every person in the team share the same linked-list structure
2. Insertion: Provide detailed node information(include the prev and the next node at the time of insertion) to make sure it will be appended to the same position
3. Deletion: Not Removed directly, but marked that the node has been removed
4. The following is the demo of the structure

#### Optimization

1. Assume that N represents the total text numbers, and M represents total blocks in an article. Each blocks has Ti texts (1 <= i <= m), Î£(Ti) = N
2. It would be time-consuming when the N is large. Each operations(Insert/Delete) would be O(N)
3. What I do: Also put blocks into a doubly linked-list, which can speed up the process
4. New structure as below
5. In this way, each operation would be O(Ti + M). In most cases, O(N) >> O(Ti + M), It is much faster than before.

#### Garbage Collection

1. In order to assure Eventual Consistency, even when user delete a text, it will not be removed directly.
2. It will lead to waste of memory resources and slowing down each operation due to the garbage its cumulated.
3. What I do: Use Garbage collector to throw the garbage, follow the [YATA Algorithm essay](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310212186_Near_Real-Time_Peer-to-Peer_Shared_Editing_on_Extensible_Data_Types) says, not removing it directly, but using a buffer to make sure it won't lead to inconsistency.
4. Example Below

#### Currently not support

1. Chinese typing
2. command Z

### Version Control

#### You can see the difference between previous version and the latest version

1. Not recording each version's whole file, but using LCS algorithm to compare difference and only save differences.

2. Allow user to see the difference between versions

### Coding in the Note

#### Can choose coding language from Python/Javascript

### Auto Saving

1. Using debounce technique
2. Waits for two seconds of inactivity before saving
